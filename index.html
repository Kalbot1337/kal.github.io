Site is on the way!

I'll be working on this site for the next few days, and then I'll start writing articles again. A bit of an explanation, my previous blog was completely messed up during the transfer. One night I got this weird urge to just change every single username I had, and deviate slightly. I had gotten bored of the current pseudonym, and decided to change things up. Expect a nice, aesthetically pleasing sight soon!
